# Data-Analysis-FreeCodeCamp
This repository includes five jupyter notebooks representing 5 data analysis projects to pass the Free Coding Camp Data Analysis course. By working on these projects, I developed solid data analysis skills, such as data wrangling, visualisation, regression, time-series analysis and more.

* Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator
* Demographic Data Analyzer
* Medical Data Visualizer
* Page View Time Series Visualizer
* Sea Level Predictor

Here is my certificate of course completion:
